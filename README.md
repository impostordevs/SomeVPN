# SomeVPN
The code put in for SomeVPN.

SomeVPN is what the name says. It's a VPN. But we have goals at hand, like getting through firewalls when needed and providing access to some websites, like [Arch Linux's Website](https://archlinux.org). **Yes, some places block this. I'm talking about you, Cherry Creek School District**

Basically, this repo contains all the source code and shit just to get a working website and configuration updater.
